- The player makes a bet and rolls two dice, counts the amount of points scored
- If the sum is __7__ or __11__, then he has won a double bet
- If the sum is __2__, __8__ or __12__, then he lost a bet
- If another sum has fallen out, this number is a point
- When a point is rolled, the player rolls the dice until __7__ is rolled, which means a loss, or until a point rolls, the player wins
